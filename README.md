# Data-Analytics-Project
## Abstract:
The goal of our project is to find out whether a left-hand person really dies young when compared with a normal person. In this project, we can get to know if left-handed people die earlier or not by using two datasets. Some of the people who had died on those lists may well have been born left-handed but spent most of their lives acting and identifying as right-handers. Their families would have described them as such when the researchers came knocking.



## Introduction:

Left-handed people tend to live significantly shorter lives than right-handers, perhaps because they face more perils in a world dominated by right-handed, according to new research. Earlier studies also suggested that left-handed people do not seem to live as long as those right-handed. In the current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers who studied the deaths of 1,000 Southern Californians report that right-handers, on average, live to be 75 years old. Left-handers typically dies at age 66.


## Objective:
The main objective of this Python project is to know whether left-hand people die young using the Bayes theorem. With this model, we can understand that do left-handers really die young, or is it a myth.
